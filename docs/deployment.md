# Deployment

## Environments

Recommended environments:

- local development
- staging
- production

Production deployment requires explicit user authorization.

## Environment Variables

Required public variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
```

Server-only secrets for future connectors must not use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixes.

## Supabase

The repository includes Supabase client helpers plus versioned SQL under `supabase/`.

Apply Phase 1 in a Supabase project with:

```bash
supabase db push
supabase db seed
```

If the Supabase CLI is not available, apply `supabase/migrations/20260720000100_phase1_core.sql` and then `supabase/seed.sql` through an approved database deployment path.

## Build Checks

Before deployment:

- lint
- typecheck
- tests
- build
- security review for secrets and RLS
- visual review of modified screens

The current `npm run build` command uses `next build --webpack` so local and CI builds do not depend on Turbopack internals that may require restricted process or port behavior in sandboxed environments. This is reversible when the target deployment environment supports Turbopack builds reliably.

## First Superadministrator

The first `super_admin` should be created by a controlled server-side or SQL process after Supabase Auth user creation. This process must not expose service role keys in browser code.

Required steps:

1. Create the user in Supabase Auth.
2. Insert or update `public.profiles` with the Auth user id and organization id.
3. Insert the `super_admin` role into `public.user_roles`.
4. Confirm RLS access with a non-service-role session.

`webmaster_admin` remains available as a legacy level-100 alias for existing DEMO sessions, but new installations should start with `super_admin`.
